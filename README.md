# Time Series Forecast Studies
## Motivation
While neural network have gain a lot of success in NLP and computer vision, there are relatively less changes for traditional time series forecasting.
This repository aims to study the lastest practical technique for time series prediction, with either statistical method, machine learning or deep neural network. I will also try to summarize practical solution from Kaggles.

# Summary of Kaggle Competition Results

# Statistical Method

# Machine Learning

# Deep Neural Network


# Prediction Interval
While forecasting accuracy is important, the prediction interval is also important and it is an area that the machine learning world has less focus on.
This repo started with the idea testing performance of Bayesian Neural Network on time series data. The Rossman Store Sales data will be used as a benchmark dataset. 

The dataset is a common retail data contain store, item, daily sales and is a good representation of general time series task.

Benchmark dataset: Rossmann Store Sales

`pip install -r requirement.txt`

# Contribution
I try to use this repository to summarize my research and finding, but any contribution are welcome.
